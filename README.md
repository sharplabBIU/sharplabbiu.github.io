## Welcome to Sharp Lab

Welcome to the Sharp Lab at Bar-Ilan University. We are dedicated to advancing the understanding of human learning and planning through cutting-edge research in computational modeling.

### Our Mission

At Sharp Lab, our mission is to unravel the complex mechanisms of learning and planning in the human brain. We employ a variety of computational tools and techniques to model these cognitive processes, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications in real-world scenarios.

### Research Focus

Our primary research areas include:

- **Learning:** Investigating the underlying principles and processes of how humans acquire new knowledge and skills.
- **Planning:** Examining how individuals anticipate and prepare for future events through various strategies.
- **Psychopathology:** Examining how precise parameters within our models explain variation in types of anxiety and depression.
- **Computational Modeling:** Utilizing mathematical models, particularly from a reinforcement learning framework, and computer simulations to predict and explain human behavior in learning and planning tasks.

### About Us

The Sharp Lab is part of the vibrant academic community at Bar-Ilan University. We collaborate with both local and international researchers to push the boundaries of cognitive science.
