## Amitai Shenhav: A discussion on the Affective Gradient Hypothesis

Here, we hear from Professor [Amitai Shenhav](https://www.shenhavlab.org/) about his recent proposal to put affect at the center of value-based decision making, motivation, cognitive control (see his paper [here](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56e19a6d04426223be32a8b9/t/66fe22de0dea8f6ac730cff3/1727931104942/Shenhav_inPress_TiCS.pdf). We discuss many big questions about the science of emotion and decision-making, including how affect relates to core concept of reinforcement learning, how this theory compares to other computationally-based models of emotion, where values come from, intrinsic versus extrinsic rewards, how to measure emotion, among others. The group of discussant included Professor [Kristen Lindquist] (https://affectivesciencelab.com/people) (Ohio State University), Associate Professor [Eran Eldar](https://sites.google.com/site/eldareran/) (Hebrew University), Assistant Professor [Hanna Keren](https://kerenlab.org/) (Bar-Ilan University), and Assitant Professor [Peter Hitchcock](https://www.translational-lab.com/) (Emory University). See all their lab pages for their important recent publications on the science of emotion.
