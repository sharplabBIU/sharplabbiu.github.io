### 12/16/24: A discussion with Peter F. Hitchcock on cognitive action learning

We discuss with Professor [Peter Hitchcock](https://www.translational-lab.com/) his recent proposal that shows the mechanics and consequences of learning cognitive actions through external reinforcement alone. See his preprint on this topic [here](https://www.psyarxiv.com/y2wqf).

### 12/12/24: A discussion with Amitai Shenhav on The Affective Gradient Hypothesis (AGH)

We discuss with Professor [Amitai Shenhav](https://www.shenhavlab.org/) his recent proposal that places affect at the foundation of value-based decision making, motivation, and cognitive control (see his paper [here](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56e19a6d04426223be32a8b9/t/66fe22de0dea8f6ac730cff3/1727931104942/Shenhav_inPress_TiCS.pdf)). Our conversation touches on many questions about the computations of emotion and decision-making, including how AGH relates to reinforcement learning, how this theory compares to other computationally-based models of emotion, where values come from, intrinsic versus extrinsic rewards, how to measure emotion, among others. The group of discussants included Professor [Kristen Lindquist](https://affectivesciencelab.com/people) (Ohio State University), Associate Professor [Eran Eldar](https://sites.google.com/site/eldareran/) (Hebrew University), Assistant Professor [Hanna Keren](https://kerenlab.org/) (Bar-Ilan University), and Assitant Professor [Peter Hitchcock](https://www.translational-lab.com/) (Emory University). See all their lab pages for their important recent publications on the science of emotion.
