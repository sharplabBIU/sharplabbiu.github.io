### Our lab uses **computational models** to understand human **learning** and **planning**. We use a reinforcement learning framework to develop explanations of these processes and their breakdown in forms of **psychopathology**.

#### We are part of the Department of Psychology at [Bar-Ilan University](https://psychology.biu.ac.il/en), near Tel-Aviv. We welcome prospective trainees from psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and engineering.
