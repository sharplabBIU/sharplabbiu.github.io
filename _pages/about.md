In this lab, we focus on distributed systems, specially IoT, Edge AI, Smart Cities, and Industry 4 topics. 
We love to implement our ideas and see them working in practice and also let others know and use the results. 
</p>
<p>
  Currently, we implement and test our researches on a 30-node IoT testbed composed of nodes mainly powered by <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/">Nordic</a> SoCs. We have also some custom boards with NRF-52833 and BLE tags.
