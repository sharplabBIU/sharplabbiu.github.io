The lab seeks to understand how humans learn and plan. We primarily use a reinforcement learning framework to develop algorithmic explanations of human learning and planning. Importantly, we also seek to use this framework to shed light on mechanisms of human anxiety.

The Lab PI, Paul, took a nontraditional path and welcomes those with diverse interests to join the team. Paul began in a clinical psychology PhD, moved to a devleopmental neuroscience lab to finish my PhD, and spent the past 5 years in computational cognitive science labs.
