### Our lab uses diverse methods, including **computational models** and **neuroimaging**, to understand human **learning** and **planning**. We draw from [reinforcement learning](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) and [bayesian models](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262049412/bayesian-models-of-cognition) to model these processes and their breakdown in **psychopathology**.

#### We are part of the Department of Psychology at [Bar-Ilan University](https://www.biu.ac.il/en), near Tel Aviv. We welcome prospective trainees from psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and engineering.
