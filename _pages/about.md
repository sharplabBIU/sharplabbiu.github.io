### Our lab seeks to understand the computational processes underlying how humans learn, plan, and make decisions. We primarily use a reinforcement learning framework to develop algorithmic explanations of these cognitive processes. Importantly, we also seek to use this framework to shed light on mechanisms of psychopathology, with specific focus on understanding mechanisms anxiety.
