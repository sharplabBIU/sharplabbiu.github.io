I recall a teacher emphasizing their love for teaching because it was a reciprocal process. As much as a joy as it was for her to guide us towards new knowledge, she was just as thankful for the ample ways in which she learned from us. Embracing intellectual humility and openness in a position of authority as a teacher and mentor are deeply important for personal and scientific growth on the part of both the teacher and students.

## asking any question

Individuals in the lab must feel that they are valued inherently for who they are. This requires creating a community where intellectual humility thrives. Thus, it is my responsibility to express what I do not know. Crafting such a lab cutlure also requires establishing a precedent to value when lab members speak up. Having a space where it is easy to ask questions will augment the lab's creativity.

## seeing the other's perspective

Creating a vibrant partnership with mentees requires perspective-taking. I try to do this by letting go of my mental model to try to understand how a mentee has constructed their own mental model. Doing this is a great example of mutual learning. When I try to understand how the student is thinking, I force myself to stretch my understanding to new terrain, and ask the student to do the same through clarifying for themselves what they mean. This frequently involves drawing diagrams, offering analogies, or working through metaphors, in order to find a common ground for understanding.

## learning through experience

It is my job to ensure students have the tools to critically evaluate their new hypotheses. This involves exposing them to philosophies of science regarding how to corroborate or falsify oneâ€™s hypotheses, tools to measure key variables in their hypotheses, and statistical methods to determine the level of credibility they should re-assign to their hypotheses after collecting data.

Fostering scientific creativity is best achieved through a project-oriented approach. This begins with the way I present material. For instance, when I ran a year-long seminar for graduate students who wanted to learn how to code in Python, we frequently would move between discussing an idea briefly and doing exercises in class. Using tools like Jupyter Notebooks, which allows students to go through material with interactive coding tools, is one such way to do so. I like to devote time for students to experiment with these embedded algorithms, tweaking parameters to see what happens to the output, which ultimately allows them to learn via their own curiosity.
