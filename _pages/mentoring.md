I recall a teacher emphasizing their love for teaching because it was a reciprocal process. As much as a joy as it was for her to guide us towards new knowledge, she was just as thankful for the ample ways in which she learned from us. Embracing intellectual humility and openness in a position of authority as a teacher and mentor are deeply important for personal and scientific growth on the part of both the teacher and students. In my roles as teacher and mentor, I adhere to three core principles that I believe create conditions for intellectual humility, creative interchange and reciprocal learning to thrive.

First is fostering an environment of inclusivity. Individuals should feel unimpeded in expressing who they are and what they believe so long as their expression is imbued with a deep respect for others. Second is to facilitate connectivity between learners by flexibly adapting to how individuals differentially represent intellectual content within their unique mental models. Third is to embed the creative scientific process within the course through project-oriented learning and lab-like exposure.

# creating an inclusive environment

Inclusivity from the broadest perspective refers to creating environments where individuals feel that they are valued inherently for who they are, which I regard as a necessary precursor to any meaningful intellectual exchange. I intend to foster inclusivity in several ways. First, I model intellectual humility by engaging in a kind of “Socratic monologue”, expressing frequently what I do and do not know, and interrogating my own certainty in views I hold. Thus, I typically preface my teaching by discussing the value of asking questions to clarify material, emphasizing that no one should ever feel ashamed of asking any question. I enjoy offering anecdotes from past experiences as both student and teacher, divulging times when I did not know seemingly obvious material and how essential getting clarification was to my learning. I also delve into times when I chose not to speak up when I didn’t understand something, and how that hurt my development.

# adjusting our mental models in dialogue

Creating a vibrant classroom community requires that a teacher take the perspective of their students. For example, in class, I endeavour to temporarily let go of my mental model of some idea the group is discussing and try to understand how a student has constructed their own mental model. Doing this is a great example of mutual learning. When I try to understand how the student is thinking, I force myself to stretch my understanding to new terrain, and ask the student to do the same through clarifying for themselves and the class what they mean. This frequently involves drawing diagrams, offering analogies, or working through metaphors, in order to find a common ground for understanding. Doing this out loud with a group tends to illuminate various points of confusion, and invites others that may be taking unique perspectives on a new idea.

In addition to facilitating mutual learning, perspective taking tends to facilitate students’ connection with the material, which has myriad benefits. When students feel comfortable expressing how the course material resonates with their own experiences, it is more likely they will retain the material, and consolidate their new knowledge in ways that can be used creatively in the future. The more a student can integrate the course material with enduring bodies of knowledge they know well, the greater potential there is for creative expression.

# learning through experience in projects

It is my job to ensure students have the tools to critically evaluate their new hypotheses. This involves exposing them to philosophies of science regarding how to corroborate or falsify one’s hypotheses, tools to measure key variables in their hypotheses, and statistical methods to determine the level of credibility they should re-assign to their hypotheses after collecting data.

Fostering scientific creativity is best achieved through a project-oriented approach. This begins with the way I present material. For instance, when I ran a year-long seminar for graduate students who wanted to learn how to code in Python, we frequently would move between discussing an idea briefly and doing exercises in class. Using tools like Jupyter Notebooks, which allows students to go through course material with interactive coding tools embedded within the lecture’s narrative, is one such way the material becomes alive for students. I like to devote time for students to play around with these embedded algorithms, tweaking parameters to see what happens to the output, which ultimately allows them to learn via their own curiosity.
