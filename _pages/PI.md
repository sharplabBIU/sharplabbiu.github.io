I am a computational cognitive scientist with a diverse academic background. I began in a clinical psychology PhD, moved to a devleopmental neuroscience lab to finish my PhD, and spent the past 5 years in computational cognitive science labs. Before coming to Bar-Ilan, I spent time in UIUC, UNC, UCL (London), Hebrew University (Jerusalem), and Yale. I am exciting to work with those who are curious about the questions our lab pursues from academic fields spanning psychology, neuroscience, computer science and engineering.
