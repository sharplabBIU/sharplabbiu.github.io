## Project description

A fuure aim of the lab in to understand how a lens of offline reinforcement learning may be able to shed light on the consequences of human imagination. Indeed, this is motivated by the seeming paradox that we can learn quickly even though we have few real-world interactions with the states, actions and rewards for a given learning problem. This can be explained by understanding how we use prior knowledge in one-shot learning (i.e., planning), how our brains have learned before our lives begin (i.e., inductive biases conferred via evolutionary-timescale learning) or offline learning (i.e., using a model of the world, or our memories, to simulate internally states, actions, and rewards). Here, we tackle the latter possibility by asking the following questions:

(1) How do beliefs form and consolidate via offline learning?
(2) What is the emotional experience engendered during or following offline learning?
(3) What fundamental representations are used in human offline learning?
