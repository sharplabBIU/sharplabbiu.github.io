## Project description

Humans have a rich imagination. Understanding how imagined scenarios relate to learning is a large question.

A fuure aim of the lab in to understand how a lens of offline reinforcement learning may be able to shed light on the consequences of human imagination. In this vein, questions we hope to ask are:

(1) Can we model the emotional consequences of offline learning?
(2) Can we model belief consolidation of offline learning?
