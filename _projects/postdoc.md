We are recruiting for a 3-year post-doctoral position in cognitive computational science. We will pursue questions about how humans plan and how that is related to anxiety. There will be chances to use MEG-based neuroimaging to study human replay. There are many questions falling under this umbrella, so please get in touch with me and we can set up a meeting!
