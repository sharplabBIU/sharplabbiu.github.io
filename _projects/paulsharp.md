I am a computational cognitive scientist with a diverse academic background. I began in a clinical psychology PhD program, moved to a developmental neuroscience lab to finish my PhD, and spent 5 years in computational cognitive science labs. Before coming to Bar-Ilan, I spent time in UIUC, UNC, UCL (London), Hebrew University (Jerusalem), and Yale. I am excited to work with aspiring trainees at any level with psychology, neuroscience, computer science and engineering backgrounds.

Please note that Markdown doesn't support all HTML features. For example, the download attribute in the <a> tag doesn't have a direct equivalent in Markdown, so I've omitted it in the conversion. The image size and alignment are also approximated using the {} syntax, which is a feature of some Markdown processors but not all. You may need to adjust these parts depending on your specific Markdown processor or website generator. Also, the links are maintained as they were in the original HTML code. If the locations of the linked files are relative to the location of the Markdown file, they should work as expected. If not, you may need to adjust the paths accordingly.
